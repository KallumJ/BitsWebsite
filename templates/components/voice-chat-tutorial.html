        <p>If you have never installed mods before, or need a refresher, here are some instructions, just select the
            launcher of your choice.</p>
        <h3>Installation Instructions:</h3>
        <button class="w3-button w3-block w3-white w3-left-align"
            onclick="revealOnAccordion('mclauncher')">Minecraft Launcher ▼</button>
        <div class="w3-hide w3-animate-opacity" id="mclauncher">
            <ol>
                <li>Head to <a class="hyperlink" href="https://fabricmc.net/use/installer">fabricmc.net</a> and
                    download the latest
                    fabric
                    installer and run it.</li>
                <li>
                    Ensuring the Minecraft Launcher is closed, and that the selected Minecraft version (underlined
                    in red) is correct, hit install.
                    <div class="installation-images">
                        <img src="../../static/assets/images/installation_instructions/mclauncher/installer.jpg"

                </li>
                <li>
                    If all goes well, a success message like this will be shown. Dismiss it, close the installer,
                    and open the Minecraft Launcher.
                    <div class="installation-images">

                <li>
                    Under the "Installations" tab in the Minecraft Launcher (underlined in blue), you should see a
                    new install called something like <code>fabric-loader-MC.VERSION.NUMBER</code>. This name is a
                    bit ugly, so hit the button with 3 dots, then edit, and give it a nicer name, and hit save.
                    <div class="installation-images">

                    Again in the "Installations" tab, click the open folder button (boxed in blue)

                <li>
                    If it doesn't exist already, create a folder in the folder that got opened called
                    <code>mods</code>

                <li>
                    Drag your download for Simple Voice Chat into the <code>mods</code> folder. <strong>NOTE IF YOU
                        ALREADY HAD A MODS FOLDER:</strong> if you already had a mods folder, you may already have
                    other mods installed. These mods will need to be Fabric mods, and work with whatever version
                    your trying to play. If they are incompatible, remove them.

                    Ensuring that the installation we just set up is selected in the installation selector
                    (highlighted in blue), hit play.

                <li>
                    Finally, dismiss this safety message. It's nothing to worry about. It's just Mojang warning they
                    can't gurantee safety features like player muting will work (they will :D). Thats all! Now
                    Simple Voice Chat is installed!
