**KallumJ is one of the owners of Bits**. He loves to make giant crazy projects with his friend Koenn, although he usually tries to do the least amount of work.
KallumJ lives in *Koenn's shadow*, but can usually be found lurking around in other people's bases, because they probably look *better*. If you need anything, you can usually just ask him, because it seems like he loves to give all of his stuff away, we suspect it's because he doesn't have any friends.

KallumJ is one of the main people behind the Bits servers, (although he lets `Koenn` do most of the work), so if you need him, it's @KallumJ on Discord.
