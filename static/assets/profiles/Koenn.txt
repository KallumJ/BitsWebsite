**Koenn is one of the owners of Bits**. He is the main programmer behind the custom plugins and bots that we use across our servers. Koenn likes to pretend he does all the work, but consistently forgets that it's his partner KallumJ that pays for all his projects. Thinks KallumJ is a replacement for Amazon prime If you need him, just message @Koenn on discord, although he is probably busy, pretending to be busy.
