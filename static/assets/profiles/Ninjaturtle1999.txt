Ninjaturtle1999 (AKA Ninja) is one of the three trouble makers on the server, along with Theengineer415, and Edahs Shade. He's from the US, and is the creator of numerous builds, including palmseaview on the 1.12 world download, Atlantis on the 1.13 download, The turtle on 1.14/1.15, and the caldera on 1.16. He also helped with numerous projects over the years, and is one of the longest playing members of the server. He really enjoys communal builds, not having to use diamonds as currancy, and building ender enders (cause they end endermen). He started the idea for a communal netherite beacon, and has failed to follow through in any measureable way, but he still feels acomplished for that. If you need something, just ask and usually he's willing to help
