Engie is first and foremost a member of a secret collation of advance builders, whoâ€™s group name is a closely guarded secret. Often seen in his modern house builds, Engie spends his time coming with with new build projects that (*hopefully*) won't cost him his gear. Again. For the 15th time time this week. That is of course, assuming his friend and sometimes roommate **Ninjaturtle** doesn't have a crazy build of his own.


Engie can be seen sporting his favorite plaid shirts, comfortable jeans, boots and his trademark redstone glasses. His glasses, which sport a clear and red lenses, allow him to pull up his project blueprints in real time. Which is great considering that dying thing we mentioned earlier. He is often very helpful to new players, or old players, and almost always has time to talk. Or prank **KallumJ**'s base.

-Bits Speedway
