Edahs Shade… Edahs Shade, now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time.  Long time… You may think he is dead, not yet.  How I know them, well of course I know him, he’s me!  I haven’t gone by the name Edahs Shade since all before you were born.  I don’t seem to ever remember needing a bio, very interesting that I was asked to make one.  I think it's best we head indoors, the sand people are easily startled, and will be back.  And in greater numbers.
